        <p>As our <b>first project,</b> Outer Travels was a space themed project, where we had to make a website around
            a
            company, that had some <b>product in space.</b> <br> <br> <b>My main role</b> in this project, was being the
            <b>project leader</b> and with us <b>only being 2 out of the 5 people</b> we were supposed to be <b>in this
                project,</b> we
            didn't have many opportunities to do something grand.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="projectsection">
        <p>This project was for <b>desktop only,</b> as an <b>introduction to html coding.</b> We started the project of
            by
            <b>brainstorming</b> ways to make a website centered around space, we decided to make a <b>dark color
                palette</b> and try
            and draw in <b>a lot of black.</b> We came up with the idea to make a website where you could choose to
            <b>travel to
                planets like a vacation. </b>

            We then had to <b>make a banner</b> and to not make the website totally black we
            decided <b>it needed some color.</b> Being a very <b>small team of 2</b> we decided to start of by <b>making
                our pages
                separately.</b> We later learnt that <b>it wasn't ideal
                to make things separately,</b> as it <b>caused some issues</b> in terms of not having the same vision
            for the project,
            when making the website.</p>

        <p><b>I was responsible for creating our landing page with a banner,</b> differnet planets you could travel to
            and <b>I made a logo</b>
            to accompany our site to further sell it as a company. One of the <b>major problems</b> in this project was
            that we had <b>no
                experience in coding html in groups</b> and <b>didn't have any tools to use,</b> to make it coding
            together easier for us. <br>
            <br> But in the end, we ended up with <b>a project we weren't fully happy with,</b> but we <b>learnt a lot
                from our
                mistakes</b> made in this project.</p>
