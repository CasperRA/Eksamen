        <p>As our first project, Outer Travels was a space themed project, where we had to make a website around some company, that had a product centered around space.</p>

        <p>We started the project of by brainstorming ways to make a website centered around space. We came up with the idea to make a website where you could choose to travel to planets like a vacation. <br> <br> Being a very small team of 2 we decided to start of by making our pages separately, which ended up not being the normal way to code as we later learned, this also caused some issues in terms of having the same vision for the project.</p>

        <p>In the end, we ended up with a project we weren't fully happy with, but we learnt a lot from our mistakes made in this project.</p>
