        <p class="xenosp1">Xenos was a project about mak√≠ng a car brand and then designing a website for it, it was created in 2 parts, we started by making a mobile version based on the target group our brand used which we picked ourselves.
          <br> <br> After researching, designing and making the website for mobile, we held a showcase, presenting our work. </p>

            After the showcase from part 1, we had a second part, which involved a reevaluating of the good and bad from our previous brand and design,
            based on feedback we got. <br> <br> Part 2 also was about making the website more responsive which also meant we
            had to make it for desktop as well.
