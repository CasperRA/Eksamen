        <p class="xenosp1">Xenos was a <b>2 part project</b> about making a car brand and website for it, <b>the first
                part</b>
            consisted of us <b>making a brand, design, website for mobile</b> and starting to <b>focus on the business
                part of our
                projects.</b>
            <br>
            <b>The Second part</b> was more so a continuation of some feedback and to <b>further develop the concept of
                Xenos</b> with more content.
            <br> <br>
            <b>My main role</b> for the first part of this project was being responsible for <b>finding a brand identity
                and
                the customers that would interact with it.</b>

            <br> <br> To start the project of, we did a lot of research about different car brands, to find what kind of
            <b>identity</b> we wanted. We ended on being a brand leaning towards being more of <b> a trust worthy,
                electric mass
                market car company,</b> with our main customer segments being people that are either, <b>
                environmentally conscious, craftsmen or early to middle aged family parrents.</b></p>

        <p>Now that we had a clear vision of what our brand should include, we started on our design and after settling
            down on a more neutral look, we began sketching, wireframing, making mockups and finally coding. <br> <br>
            In the coding part I was responsible for creating a website for craftsmen and making our pullout menu to
            connect all of our webpages together.</p>

            We then had a showcase of our work from part 1 and after getting feedback, it was back to the drawingboard
            to begin part 2.
            <br> <br> In part 2 I was responsible for making our contentplan, deciding on what kind of content should be
            put out for our customers, here I created a webpage with the current campaigns from Xenos on it. Updated the
            menu and some other pages to have more cohesiveness.
            <!-- After the showcase from part 1, we had a second part, which involved a reevaluating of the good and bad from
            our previous brand and design,
            based on feedback we got. <br> <br> Part 2 also was about making the website more responsive which also
            meant we
            had to make it for desktop as well. -->

        <img class="xenosimg2" src="/images/xenosmobile2.png" alt="xenos mobile pages part 2">
        <p class="pfinal">Finally at the end we made the website responsive to desktop, where we added more whitespace
            and could get a bit more creative with some of our design decisions.</p>
