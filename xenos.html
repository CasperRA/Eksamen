        <p>Xenos was created in 2 parts, first a mobile version based on a target group which we had to pick ourselves.
            After picking we then designed and created the website for mobile at first and had a showcase to recieve
            feedback from our work.</p>

            After the showcase from part 1, we had a second part, which involved a reevaluating of the good and bad, based on feedback we got. <br> Part 2 also was about making the website more responsive which also meant we had to make it for desktop as well.
