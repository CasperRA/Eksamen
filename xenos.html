        <p class="xenospintro">Xenos was a <b>2 part project</b> about making a car brand and website for it, <b>the
                first
                part</b>
            consisted of us <b>making a brand, design, website for mobile</b> and starting to <b>focus on the business
                part of our
                projects.</b>
            <br>
            <b>The Second part</b> was more so a continuation of some feedback and to <b>further develop the concept of
                Xenos</b> with more content.
            <br> <br>
            <b>My main role</b> for the first part of this project was being responsible for <b>finding a brand identity
                and
                the customers that would interact with it.</b>

            <br> <br> To start the project of, we did a lot of research about different car brands, to find what kind of
            <b>identity</b> we wanted. We ended on being a brand leaning towards being more of <b> a trust worthy,
                electric mass
                market car company,</b> with our main customer segments being people that are either, <b>
                environmentally conscious, craftsmen or early to middle aged family parrents.</b></p>

    <section class="projectsection">
        <p class="xenosp1">Now that we had a <b>clear vision</b> of what our brand should include, we started on our
            <b>design</b> and
            after settling
            down on a more neutral look, <b>we began sketching, wireframing, making mockups and finally coding.</b> <br>
            <br>
            In the coding part, I was <b>responsible for</b> creating a <b>website for craftsmen and making our pullout
                menu</b> to
            connect all of our webpages together.</p>

        <p class="xenosp2">
            We then had a <b>showcase of our work from part 1</b> and after getting <b>feedback</b>, it was back to the
            drawingboard
            to <b>begin part 2.</b>
            <br> <br> In part 2 I was <b>responsible for making our contentplan,</b> deciding on what kind of content
            should be
            put out for our customers, here <b>I created a webpage with the current campaigns Xenos was running</b>.
            Updated the
            menu and did some <b>fixing on other pages to have more cohesiveness</b>.
        </p>
        <img class="xenosimg2" src="/images/xenosmobile2.png" alt="xenos mobile pages part 2">
        <p class="xenosp3">Finally <b> at the end,</b> we made the website <b>responsive to desktop</b> where we added
            more <b>whitespace</b>
            and tried to get a bit more <b>creative with</b> some of our <b>design decisions</b>. But ultimately, we had
            <b>more we could
                improve upon</b> in our website design, to make it <b>more appealing to our target group and fix some
                errors.</b></p>
