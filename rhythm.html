        <p>In this project, we had to make a website for a bollywood dance studio, this was a bit different from
            previous
            projects as we received a website from another group, which we then had to improve upon. <br> <br> The website we
            received wasn't up to par with our vision for what a bollywood website should look like, so we ended up
            making a new one from scratch to have a clear design and
            consistency over our several pages.</p>

        <p>After doing research on the bollywood dance we started looking into creating a moodboard as a sort of "design
            guide" for everyone on the team to follow.</p>

        <p>We started coding our website, mobile first, with these design decisions in mind. After being done with the
            mobile version we made breakpoints to further develop the website for dekstop users. As usual we had a final
            showcase to show of our work.</p>
