        <p>This project was the <b>2nd part of our dance theme,</b>  in this project we recieved <b>another groups website,</b> had to
            work upon it and make it <b>responsive for desktop.</b> This projects theme was a <b>bollywood dancing school.</b> 
            <br><br>
        <b>My main role </b>for this project was <b>organizing</b> our work, being responsible for <b>some</b> of our <b>design choices</b> and
    <b>helping everyone with coding.</b>
            <br> <br>
            As we recieved the project from the other group, we realised that we had to <b>rework their current design</b> to
            something new, so we quickly did some <b>brainstorming</b> and got some <b>individual moodboards</b> ready <b>and made our
        final moodboard.</b> </p>

        <p>We then started <b>making sketches and wireframes</b> for our website, made some <b>final mockups</b> with our chosen
            design and name on it and then we <b>started working on the code.</b> As we choose to redo the other groups work
            from scratch, it meant that this was <b>the first time we had to make a site for both mobile and desktop.</b> 
            <br> <br>
            So we
            got to work on the <b>mobile version</b> making pages that had an <b>"okay" flow,</b> because we <b>hadnt been totally clear
            on when to use certain elements, colors and fonts.</b> </p>

        <p>The page <b>I was responsible for</b> making, was <b>our sign up page and our menu.</b> As we continued making our
            website and <b>started</b> to code <b>the desktop version,</b> we slowly finished the site, but as a result of our
        <b>miscommunication</b> had some <b>flaws in its cohesiveness.</b>
