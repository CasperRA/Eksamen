        <p>As this project was <b>our second project ever,</b> it was all about <b>learning</b> how to make a website
            for <b>mobile.</b> Our
            project theme this time, was about a <b>swingdance dance studio</b> and was the <b>first part</b> of our
            dance themed
            projects, where in the <b>next part we swap projects</b> and work upon and redo some parts of each others
            projects. <br> <br> <b>My main role</b> in this project was
            doing some <b>primary research,</b> find out what kind of people dance swing and <b>making design
                decisions.</b>
            <br> <br> We started off our research by doing some <b>desk research</b> and ended up finding a little dance
            school
            in Copenhagen named <b>"Happy Feet",</b> which <b>one of my project members and I visited.</b> We took
            <b>inspiration</b> from the
            vibe at the <b>dance school</b> and from other <b>similar websites</b> to decide what kind of style we were
            looking and made a <b>
                color palette.</b>

        <p class="swingp1"> Then it was <b>time for some sketching, wireframing and mockups,</b> trying to appeal to a
            <b>vintage crowd</b>
            while stile being an <b>easy to use modern website.</b> </p>

        <p>When we started to <b>code our website</b> we ran into <b>alot of problems,</b> this being our second project
            and our <b>first
                project for mobile,</b> it was alot harder to cope with all the new things we had learnt about. But
            <b>we managed to pull
                through</b> and got close to what we originally were looking for in our website. It wasn't fully what we
            wanted out of it though and <b>could definitely be improved upon.</b> <br><br>
            <b>I was responsible for making</b> the page where you are able to see <b>what classes are held when and
                what the upcomming events are.</b> (The page in the middle, down below) </p>

        <p class="swingfinal">At the end of this project we had a <b>final showcase</b> and then afterwards we
            <b>swapped our swingdance website with
                another groups project,</b> see more about <b>part 2 in the Rhythm Studio project.</b></p>
