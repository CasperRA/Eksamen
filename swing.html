        <p>As this project was our second project ever, it was all about learning how to make a mobile website. Our project this time was about a swingdance dance studio. <br> <br> We started off by making desk research and found a little dance school in copenhagen named "Happy Feet", we visited them and got a feel for what swingdancing was all about and then got to work. </p>

        <p>When we started to code our website we ran into alot of problems, this being our second project and our first for mobile, it was alot harder to cope with all the new things we had learnt. <br> <br> We managed to pull through and got close to what we originally were looking for in our website.  </p>

        <p>At the end of this project we had a final showcase and then afterwards we swapped our swingdance website with another group, see more about that in the Rhythm Studio project.</p>
